FORK COMMENTS
=============

ncdu-annex is a quick hack created to easily examine the size of the
Git Annex repositories.

Changes include:
- Automatically ignore (--exclude) the ".git/annex" directory with the actual files, as we are only interested in the symlinks to them.
- Uses stat(2) instead of lstat(2) to follow symlinks when calculating the file/directory size.
- Use "git annex drop" to "delete" the files (the "d" key).
- UI changes to reflect some of the changes.

It is probably not production-ready and the calculations will
definitely be inaccurate in presence of any other symlinks apart from
the Git Annex ones.

What could be improved:
- Handling the "git annex drop" errors.
- Handling of the non-annex symlink.
- Probably some more integration.

Recommended configure flags: --program-suffix=-annex


ncdu 1.12g
==========

DESCRIPTION

  ncdu (NCurses Disk Usage) is a curses-based version of
  the well-known 'du', and provides a fast way to see what
  directories are using your disk space.


REQUIREMENTS

  In order to compile and install ncdu, you need to have
  at least...

  - a POSIX-compliant operating system (Linux, BSD, etc)
  - curses libraries and header files


INSTALL

  The usual:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    make install

  If you're building directly from the git repository, make sure you have perl
  (or rather, pod2man), pkg-config and GNU autoconf/automake installed, then
  run 'autoreconf -i', and you're ready to continue with the usual ./configure
  and make route.
